This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the app clone this repo and run 

```
$ yarn 
```

to install all the packages

then run 

```
$ yarn start 
```

to start the dev server.

Make shure that your backend runs on localhost:8181. If not you need to change the URL variable in models.js
